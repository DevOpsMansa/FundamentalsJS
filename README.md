# Fundamentals of JavaScript #

## Grades of Students in a class
This evaluates students in a class over assignment grades and course average grade point for JavaScript.
## Objectives of this project:

### Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
### Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
### Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
### Develop functions to create reusable code.
### Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
### Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

## Project Details Instructions 
You will create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application. The data you will use is provided below.
You will be provided with four different types of data:

A CourseInfo object, which looks like this:
{"id": number, "name": string,}

An AssignmentGroup object, which looks like this:
{"id": number, "name": string, // the ID of the course the assignment group belongs to
  "course_id": number, // the percentage weight of the entire assignment group "group_weight": number,"assignments": [AssignmentInfo],}

Each AssignmentInfo object within the assignments array looks like this:
{"id": number,"name": string,// the due date for the assignment
  "due_at": Date string,// the maximum points possible for the assignment 
  "points_possible": number,
}

An array of LearnerSubmission objects, which each look like this:
{"learner_id": number,"assignment_id": number,"submission": {
"submitted_at": Date string,"score": number}
}

## The goal is to analyze and transform this data such that the output of your program is an array of objects, each containing the following information in the following format:
{
    // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected
    "id": number,
    // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
    // with more points_possible should be counted for more
    // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
    // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
    "avg": number,
    // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
    // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
    // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
    <assignment_id>: number,
    // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
    // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
}

### Project main functions:

1. getLearnerData( CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission] ) - main function. input parameters:

* CourseInfo

* AssignmentGroup

* Array of LearnerSubmission output: array of student objects

2. getLearner(learners, learner_id) - additional function. Provide the student object for which the assignment score would be calculated. Function checked if in learners array we have information about the scores for student with id = "learner_id" then returns this student object. If we wanted to calculate score for new student, that function declate the student object, add it to learners array and return it. input parameters:

* learners - array of all students in course which has any kind of scores

* learner_id - the id of student output: student object that exists in learners

3. calculateAssignmentScore(student, assignmentInfo, learnerSubmition) - additional function. Function calculates the assignment score. input parameters:

* student - student object in which we will add information about the assignment score

* assignmentInfo - AssignmentInfo object

* learnerSubmission - LearnerSubmission.submission property information

4. calculateAverageScore(studentsScores) - additional function. Calculates average scores for all students who submitted any assignmnents input parameters:

* studentScores - array of students objects

5. deleteAdditionalProperties(dataArray, ...properties) - additional function. Function that delete any properlies from the object input parameters:

* dataArray - array of objects. We want to delete properties from every object in array

* properties - array of property's names
